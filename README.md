# SilverBullet MCP Server

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a bridge to your [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md) instance. It enables Large Language Models (LLMs) and other MCP-compatible clients to interact with your SilverBullet notes and data by exposing them through standardized MCP `tools` and `resources`.

The server is designed to be run via Docker Compose alongside your existing SilverBullet Docker container. It handles authentication and provides a secure way for external applications to access and manipulate your SilverBullet space.

## Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-A0/silverbullet-mcp.git
    cd silverbullet-mcp
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Update the `.env` file with your specific values:
    *   `SB_AUTH_TOKEN`: The token this MCP server uses to access SilverBullet. For multi-space servers, use a Dashboard-issued API token with access to the target space.
    *   `MCP_TOKEN`: A secure token for clients (e.g., your AI model) to authenticate with this MCP server.
    *   `SB_API_BASE_URL`: (Optional if running via docker-compose as defined) The base URL for the SilverBullet API. Defaults to `http://silverbullet:3000` in the `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   `PORT`: (Optional if running via docker-compose as defined) The port the MCP server will listen on. Defaults to `4000`.

3.  **Build and run the services using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Build the Docker image for the `silverbullet-mcp-server` if it doesn't exist or if `Dockerfile` or related files have changed.
    *   Pull the tested SilverBullet 2.11.0 slim image (override with `SILVERBULLET_IMAGE`).
    *   Start both the SilverBullet instance and the MCP server.

    The SilverBullet instance will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
    The MCP server will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Existing SilverBullet and multi-space servers

Set `SB_API_BASE_URL` to the full address of the target space, including its path
binding. Do not append `/.fs` and do not infer the URL from the space's display name.
For example:

```dotenv
SB_API_BASE_URL=http://your-silverbullet-host:3000/work
SB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-dashboard-issued-api-token
MCP_TOKEN=your-separate-mcp-client-token
```

Then start only the MCP service:

```sh
docker compose up --build --no-deps silverbullet-mcp-server
```

The hostname must be reachable from the MCP container; `localhost` inside that
container refers to the MCP container itself. Hostname-bound spaces need their
configured hostname. See SilverBullet's [Dashboard](https://silverbullet.md/Dashboard)
and [authentication](https://silverbullet.md/Authentication) documentation.

The bundled two-service Compose example retains legacy single-space mode for
existing `./space` folders. It is not a multi-space migration tool. For an existing
multi-space server, create tokens in its Dashboard rather than setting the
SilverBullet server's legacy `SB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

A `404 No space here` from `/.fs` usually means the configured URL points at the
instance root rather than the space. Compose now respects `SB_API_BASE_URL` from
`.env`. List/read/create/replace/delete and resource reads have been verified
against a disposable SilverBullet 2.11.0 multi-space server.

## Discovery and caching

`resources/list` returns up to 100 notes and a `nextCursor` for the next page.
Pass it as `cursor` until no next cursor is returned. Direct `sb-note://` resource
reads and the `list-notes` tool remain available.

File listings are cached for 30 seconds and concurrent listing requests share one
fetch. Successful MCP writes and deletes invalidate listing and content caches.
Edits made outside MCP may take up to 30 seconds to appear in listing-backed
operations. `read-note` reads directly; `read-multiple-notes` accepts
`enableCaching: false` to bypass its content cache (its note discovery still uses
the listing cache). Content caching retains at most 256 notes.

`search-replace-note` always treats replacement text literally, including `$1`,
`$&`, and `$$`, even when `useRegex` enables regex matching of the search pattern.

## Editing notes and structured tool results

Use `edit-note` for precise edits. Example tool arguments:

```json
{
  "filename": "Projects/Plan.md",
  "edits": [
    { "oldText": "Status: draft", "newText": "Status: approved", "expectedMatches": 1 }
  ],
  "dryRun": true
}
```

Matching is literal and case-sensitive, with one expected match per edit by
default. Every edit is matched against the original note, so replacements never
cascade into subsequent edits. A missing, ambiguous, or overlapping match rejects
the entire batch without writing. `expectedMatches` permits intentional multiple
replacements. Empty `oldText` is rejected; empty `newText` deletes the matched text.

A dry run returns a unified diff and the note's `revision`. To apply that preview,
repeat the arguments with `dryRun: false` and `expectedRevision` set to the returned
revision. The tool also uses the revision it reads as an HTTP write precondition,
so a concurrent change between its read and write fails rather than being lost.
This requires a SilverBullet server implementing ETag/If-Match semantics (tested
on 2.11). If no strong ETag is returned, changed edits cannot be applied; previews
still work. Unchanged edits make no write. Diffs are capped at 50,000 characters,
with `diffTruncated` indicating omitted output. The diff computation has a one-second
budget; exceeding it rejects the edit before writing.

`search-replace-note` remains available with its existing case-insensitive,
replace-all defaults. It does not provide revision protection; use `edit-note`
for that. Invalid regexes now return errors instead of falling back to literal
matching. `search-notes` also accepts `useRegex: false` for literal searches.

All eight tools advertise an `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent` on
success alongside the existing readable text. Tool failures return `isError: true`
and an explanation; successful output schemas do not describe error results.
Batch reads and searches include per-note errors when only some reads fail.

Returned data is bounded:

- `read-note`: `offset` and `limit` (default 50,000, maximum 100,000 characters),
  plus `nextOffset`, `totalCharacters`, and the full note's `revision`. Offsets
  count JavaScript UTF-16 code units. If the revision changes between pages,
  restart the read to avoid combining different note versions.
- `list-notes`: `limit` (default 100, maximum 500) and `cursor`; results contain
  `nextCursor` and the filtered total. Keep filters unchanged when advancing.
- `read-multiple-notes`: up to 100 notes and `contentLimit` (default 50,000,
  maximum 100,000 characters per note). Truncated notes report `truncated` and
  `totalCharacters`; retrieve the remainder with `read-note`.
- `search-notes`: up to 100 results per page and `maxMatchesPerNote` (default 20,
  maximum 100). Returned line snippets are capped at 2,000 characters and context
  at 4,000. Scores count all matches; `matchesTruncated` flags omitted matching
  lines. Counts and page numbers must be positive integers; context may be zero.

`create-note` still defaults to refusing overwrite. It only treats an actual 404
as a missing note and sends `If-None-Match: *` to prevent a racing creation from
being overwritten on servers supporting conditional writes.

## Connecting to the MCP Server

This MCP server runs as part of a Docker Compose setup and will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

You can connect to this server using an MCP client. The method of connection and authentication depends on the client's capabilities.

### Using `mcp-remote` (Docker + stdio-only clients)

If your MCP client only supports `stdio` connections (e.g., older versions of Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf), you can use `mcp-remote` to bridge the connection to this HTTP-based MCP server.

`mcp-remote` acts as a local stdio MCP server that proxies requests to a remote HTTP MCP server, handling authentication in the process.

**Client Configuration with Authentication:**

This MCP server requires token-based authentication. Configure your MCP client (e.g., in `claude_desktop_config.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, or `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`) to use `mcp-remote` and pass the `MCP_TOKEN` via a custom header:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "silverbullet-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:4000/mcp", 
        "--transport",
        "http-only",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:Bearer ${MCP_SERVER_TOKEN}" 
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_TOKEN": "your_actual_mcp_token_from_dotenv"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Important:**
* Replace `"your_actual_mcp_token_from_dotenv"` with the actual value of `MCP_TOKEN` you have set in your `.env` file for the `silverbullet-mcp-server`.
* Some clients (like Cursor and Claude Desktop on Windows) have issues with spaces in `args`. The example above (`Authorization:Bearer ${MCP_SERVER_TOKEN}`) avoids this.
* Ensure `npx` can find `mcp-remote`. You might need to add `-y` as the first argument to `args` (e.g., `["-y", "mcp-remote", ...]`) or install `mcp-remote` globally (`npm install -g mcp-remote`).

Refer to the [`mcp-remote` documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-remote) for more advanced configurations, including OAuth support (not used by this server's default auth), different transport strategies, and troubleshooting.

### Direct Connection (for Streamable HTTP clients)

If your MCP client supports Streamable HTTP transport and can send custom headers, you can connect to it directly.

The server supports two methods for token-based authentication:

1.  **Authorization Header (Recommended)**:
    *   Header Name: `Authorization`
    *   Header Value: `Bearer YOUR_MCP_TOKEN`

2.  **Query Parameter**:
    *   Append `?token=YOUR_MCP_TOKEN` to the server URL.
    *   Example: `http://localhost:4000/mcp?token=YOUR_MCP_TOKEN`

Replace `YOUR_MCP_TOKEN` with the actual value of the `MCP_TOKEN` environment variable set in your `.env` file.

**Endpoint**: `http://localhost:4000/mcp` (or as configured by `PORT` if not using Docker Compose defaults).

Consult your MCP client's documentation on how to configure connections to remote HTTP MCP servers, including how to send custom headers or append query parameters.


### Direct stdio (pure stdio, no docker)

If your MCP client can launch a local process over stdio, you can run the server
directly without Docker or the HTTP listener. No `MCP_TOKEN` is needed — the
spawning client is the only caller — but `SB_AUTH_TOKEN` (and the optional
`SB_API_BASE_URL`) must be set so the server can reach SilverBullet.

As the package is not yet published to any package registery, you have to clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "silverbullet": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/silverbullet-mcp/dist/stdio.js"],
      "env": {
        "SB_API_BASE_URL": "http://your-silverbullet-host:3000",
        "SB_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-dashboard-issued-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will provide you direct access to your SilverBullet instance without any docker container requirement.


## Development and testing

Use Node.js 24 LTS and install the locked dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
npm test
```

`npm test` builds TypeScript and runs the real HTTP MCP server against an
in-memory SilverBullet HTTP fixture. It checks authentication, independent
sessions, note reads and writes, resource reads, missing notes, session deletion,
and a space URL prefix. The fixture uses disposable notes, random local ports,
and test-only tokens; it does not read `.env` or access your `space/` directory.
No Docker or live SilverBullet credentials are needed. CI runs this suite on
Node.js 22 and 24.

The regression checks for dollar replacements, session recovery, and cache races
are included in `npm test`. To run only those checks:

```sh
npm run test:regressions
```

For a real compatibility check, run:

```sh
npm run test:live
# Or with Podman:
CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman npm run test:live
```

This pulls the pinned SilverBullet 2.11.0 slim image and creates a temporary local
server, accounts, tokens, and spaces. It mounts no host notes and removes its
container afterward. Docker or Podman must be available. CI runs both the fixture
suite and real-server checks before publishing an image.
